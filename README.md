# UrbanDictionary-Enpoint-Example

Urban dictionary has a couple of endpoints that can be used to define words. Documentation for them can be found on [mashape](https://market.mashape.com/community/urban-dictionary)

This repository provides an example of how to use Microsoft's C++ REST SDK to interact with the endpoints. The real reason for this is so that I can always refer back to a simple, working example of the SDK.
